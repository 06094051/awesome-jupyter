# Not so awesome

* [The World of Jupyter â€” a Tutorial](https://github.com/barbagroup/jupyter-tutorial)
  * A bit dated
* [IPython](http://ipython.org/) is an ancestor of Jupyter project, and now it's a Python kernel for Jupyter.
  * Probably not worth including just for historical reasons; no individual kernels
* [Jupyter Notebook cheatsheet](https://www.cheatography.com/weidadeyue/cheat-sheets/jupyter-notebook/)
  * Obsolete with the Commands tab in JupyterLab
* [Jupyter Notebook on Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/virtual-machines-linux-jupyter-notebook)
  * Article does not seem to exist anymore, page redirects
* [Jupyter Notebook on FullStackPython](https://www.fullstackpython.com/jupyter-notebook.html)
  * Most of the resources on this list are mentioned here anyway
* [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) can render your public notebook from GitHub repo or any URL.
  * GitHub can render notebooks out-of-the box. This probably makes NBViewer obsolete. Please correct me if that's not the case.
* [Using the IPython Notebook as a Teaching Tool](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2013/03/using-notebook-as-a-teaching-tool.html)
  * A bit dated; not all that useful.
* [nbTranslate](https://github.com/jfbercher/jupyter_nbTranslate) - translate cells of a notebook from one language to another - Adds multi language support.
  * not sure if useful; feel free to suggest to include this
* [nbtranslate](https://github.com/devrt/nbtranslate) - translate content of Jupyter notebook using gettext tools.
  * not sure if useful; feel free to suggest to include this
* [https://github.com/taavi/ipython_nose]
  * not sure if useful; feel free to suggest to include this
* [runipy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/runipy)
  * deprecated, use [Jupyter's execute API instead](http://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute_api.html)
* [ipynb](https://github.com/ipython/ipynb) - Package / Module importer for importing code from Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb)
  * Looks like an anti-pattern, porting code to a library seems preferable
* [pypi Jupyter](https://pypi.org/search/?q=Jupyter) - Packages on pypi that match the search term "Jupyter"
  * not a particularly useful way to discover Jupyter packages
